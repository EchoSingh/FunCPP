# FunCPP

Welcome to **FunCPP**! This repository is a collection of fun and creative C++ projects, where you can explore simulations, animations, and much more. Perfect for learning, experimenting, and enjoying the art of programming.

## Projects
### 1. Heart Pumping Animation
A captivating heart animation created using SDL2 and C++. The heart pulses dynamically, filling with vibrant red color, simulating a heartbeat effect.

**Features:**
- Heart shape rendered using a polar equation.
- Dynamic scaling to simulate a realistic heartbeat effect.
- Real-time animation using SDL2.

**Demo:**
Watch the heart pump in real-time! (Add a GIF or video link showcasing the animation here)

### 2. Donut Simulation
A 3D rotating donut simulation rendered in the terminal. This project demonstrates the use of ASCII art and mathematical transformations to create stunning visual effects.

**Features:**
- Rotating 3D donut using ASCII characters.
- Real-time rendering in the terminal.
- Adjustable rotation speed and perspective.

**Demo:**
Experience the rotating donut! (Add a GIF or video link showcasing the simulation here)

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: For logic and implementation.
- **SDL2**: For rendering graphics in animations.
- **ASCII Art**: For terminal-based visual effects.
